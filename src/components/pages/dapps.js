Nonfunctioning block producers are temporarily swapped out after missing just 30 minutes, as opposed to 3 hours on the EOS mainnet, so that developers encounter fewer pauses and problems without compromising security. Fair pay ensures all active and standby block producers are ready to produce at all times for maximum performance and stability.'

Telosâ€™ decentralized voting system ensures that the blockchain is guided by the will of the community and the steady hand of the most competent block producers.',
