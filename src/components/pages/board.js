Jan has a background in investing and has agreed to be bound by the trading restrictions regarding secrecy and trading TLOS RAM on his own account or that of his organization while serving as the RAM Administration Director.

I have a bachelors in Pure and Industrial Chemistry, originally from Nigeria. I am a naturalized citizen of the USA, but my journey to who I am and what I have become today was not an easy one. I came into United States with twenty dollars in my pocket and a big dream in my heart. I worked menial jobs to make ends meet during my first few years in the country. My faith and personal relationship with Jesus Christ has carried me since I committed my life to Him during my last year of college in 1999 and definitely sustained me through those trying years in the States. I grew up in an entrepreneurial household back in Nigeria where we don\'t work for people. When I got my first laptop when I arrived the United States, I kept saying that the computer and internet was going to change the world. My entrepreneurial journey led me to search for online businesses and through divine connections, I found a website called e-harmony.com. This was where I met my wife and we have been married for fourteen years with three lovely kids. My wife and I did not know how to do anything online, even her email address started with nointernetforme. She found the most precious person in her life, me, through the thing she distrusted the most, the internet. What irony!

Having observed the limitations of other smart contract platforms, I knew EOS  was going to be the game changer. After the launch of EOS and the various issues that came up, I was bit disappointed until I heard about the Telos network. Since I discovered it, I have been fascinated with how the network and ecosystem has been progressing so much that it is the topic I mostly frequently write and make Youtube videos about now. I am excited about the technological and development partsof this ecosystem and I\'m still learning, but I am more like the average guy that believes in the power of decentralization. It\'s time to take back our data and our lives from the powers that be. As your Telos foundation board nominee, I am all for mass adoption which is really about getting the little guy off the street to be a part of this great technical revolution. I believe that the Telos network has all it takes to be a big piece of this revolution.'
