				<h4>Article XVII - Consideration</h4>

				<h4>Article XIX - Counterparts</h4>
				<p>This Constitution may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall constitute a duplicate original, but all counterparts together shall constitute a single agreement.</p>
