I graduated from the University of Vermont Law School where I served on law review. I work with a number of computer software companies in my practice. I have been involved in blockchain since late 2016 as an investor and POS staker. I admit that this area is still somewhat new to me but I will strive to be honest and fair, to hear from all parties in a case, and to seek to thoroughly understand the technical issues involved in any case before ruling.',
