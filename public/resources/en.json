If you had an EOS account during the EOS genesis launch, you have Telos. To access your tokens, simply use your original EOS genesis keys in a verified wallet that supports Telos. Verified wallets are listed here: <a href=\"/downloads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Downloads</a>.",

          "Simply, it is that all Telos genesis addresses will receive the same number of tokens as their corresponding EOS addresses held in the genesis snapshot—up to a maximum of 40,000 tokens. There are a few exceptions to this policy: Addresses proven to have been stolen, phished, or misregistered, thereby depriving their rightful owners of them, were restored to new addresses controlled by their rightful owners; and new genesis tokens were created to compensate the launch group and establish the Telos Foundation."

          "Having received a B.S. Biological Sciences (2007) and a B.S. Nursing (2010) from Louisiana State University, Blake Lagarde’s journey towards arbitration candidacy is a unique one. He has spent his decade long professional career as a Registered Nurse, presently at Children’s Hospital in his home town of New Orleans.  What he lacks in traditional law practice is made up by first hand experience with and a passion for EOS and Telos (and Ethereum by proxy) blockchain token recovery.  Nearly 2 weeks after the EOS Genesis Snapshot and Mainnet launch, Blake personally created the now 1,300 member EOS Lost Non-Compromised (Genesis) Key Group on Telegram--an EOS 911 partner.  He has also served as an administrator for the 2,200 member EOS 911, known together with the former as the \"EOS Lost Key Community.\"  He has led the effort to find a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@blaketlagarde/safe-recovery-of-eos-genesis-accounts-with-lost-non-compromised-private-keys-944d48a6dde6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">solution</a> for those with lost non-compromised genesis keys (as well as some fringe cases).  He penned the EOS Lost Key <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/eos-block-producers-ecaf-a-solution-for-individuals-with-lost-non-compromised-eos-private-keys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Petition</a> which has garnered the support and signature of over 1,700+ individuals.  Through Blake’s personal outreach the Lost Key movement has also received endorsement or support from over 30 EOS Block Producers, many of whom fill the ‘Top 21’ today.  Because of the work in and commitment to the EOS Lost Key community, he was approached by Douglas Horn to join the Telos Launch Group (TLG) with a focus on token recovery.",
          "Per Douglas Horn, as a member of the TLG, \"[Blake has] been an important part of [telos launch group]. [Blake] brought a lot of credibility for us in the Lost Key community at a time when people still did not know whether they could trust us. For those who do not know, Blake played a key role in getting the ECAF to reach out to their entire email list about Telos key recovery. And he diligently worked with people who were having problems [with telos token recovery] He also prevented a lot of thefts from people testing our process.\"",
          "From pioneering the EOS lost key effort, to being the first EOS holder to receive a lost key claim ruling from the ECAF, and personally working on telos token recovery support and validation; the next logical step in Blake’s intimate journey through the world of cryptocurrency and lost or stolen private keys is to become an official Telos Arbitrator.  To date, Blake has already assisted 160 individuals recover their 300,000+ telos tokens.  He looks forward to the future as an opportunity to continue to help those with blockchain issues on a more official basis.",
          "When Blake is not advocating for those with lost keys, his time is spent with his life partner of ten year, Dr. Anneliese Boettcher (PhD Neuropsychology), and their two beautiful mutts Hubie (in picture) and Sula.  When Blake and Anna are not at a music festival or catching a local artist play a show, they are both active members in NOLA’s Mental Health Advocacy Sources, such as the Brett Thomas Doussan Foundation, with a focus on suicide prevention."
