Unfortunately, this means that anyone whose keys were lost or compromised at that time or since that time will also need their keys replaced on the Telos chain. For this reason, we’re working to alert EOS genesis token holders that Telos will allow them to revise their keys where necessary.",

Because Telos is using the original ERC-20 snapshot, we can verify ownership based on the Ethereum address that held those keys and can bypass any phishing or other key loss that may have happened to accounts after EOS launched. We have a special window of time in which to help anyone who lost their EOS accounts to maintain control of their new Telos accounts.",
